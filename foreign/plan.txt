ok, this is the plan for generating all getters/setters:

1 - make the script find all get/set/has/is attributes. DONE
2 - generate the cel attributes (so we replace all the %cel_attribute manually created commands by automatically generated stuff). DONE
3 - generate the cs attributes. DONE
4 - do setter (write only attributes also). DONE
5 - add the script to the build system so this will be generated automatically.

Note we will need only to find a way to infere attributes such as the Forward() IsMovingForward() --> MovingForward. DONE

BUGS:
-there are still many getters/setters not exported due to having multiple input/output args.
